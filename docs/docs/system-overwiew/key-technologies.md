- **RISC0 zkVM**: A zero-knowledge virtual machine used to generate cryptographic proofs of computation integrity without exposing private inputs.

- **SNARK Proofs**: Succinct, non-interactive proofs that validate the correctness of computations and data integrity with minimal overhead.

- **Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)**: A tree-like data structure that allows efficient storage and proof generation for large datasets, used here for Ethereum block hashes.

- **Starknet**: A Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables scalable and trust-minimized computation and storage.

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system used for storing and retrieving Ethereum block header data.
